        <h3>Class</h3>
    <p>
        Classes are pieces of functional code that has been pre written. We can call on these classes using a simple python command like (turtle.Trutle) this calls the turtle class.<br> <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud645-nd/l-3524089779/m-1013498739">Udacity Overview of "Class"</a><br><br>There is a file called turtle and inside that is a class called turtle, there is an init function (__init__)within the class. This creates space in memory to make an object or instance of the class. <br><br> Twilio is not part of the standard library and is an external python package that can be easily configured. Many other packages are<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=browse"> available here </a><br><a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/python/install">Twilio sample code page</a><br><br>The python "from" statement allows you to import specific attributes from a module.  For example when using "from twilio import rest" .  This refers back to a specific folder (rest) and class (twilioRestClient) and the actual  function within the module. This function allows us to create an instance and use it to complete our requested task.

        <h3>Intro to Programming</h3>
    <p>
        Computers through use of programs is a universal machine and can do a lot of useful things. <br> A program tells the computer what to do. <br>  An interpreter is an application that allows you to run other applications within in it, like python shell. For example Python is an application and applications can be written in the python language to make an application. <br> Python is a single programming language

        <h3>Variables and Strings</h3>
    <p>
        What is the difference in a variable and a String<br> Variables must be defined first using a variable name and an equals value <br> A String can be defined without a name <br>Indexing Strings Indexes start at zero <br> How to use <b>Find</b>, Find is a procedure which is built into python and allows you to "find" a specific element within the string.

        <h3>Input > Function > Output</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Functions</b> are used to take an input, preform and action, and return an output <br> to make a function start the line with def followed by the function name and parameters. <br> To use a function, we write the name of the function followed by the value(s) we want to give it in parentheses. <br> Functions are valuable to performing "functions" on <b>data</b> and providing an output <b>information</b>.

        <h3>Structured Data: Lists and For Loops</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Lists</b> are a way to capture data. <br> functions can be placed around the data to produce specific outputs as defined <br> Mutation means we can change the value of a list once created. <br><b> Aliasing</b> allows you to assign a new variable to an existing list that may already have a variable name. <b> For Loops</b> use the <b>for</b> command to loop though a set input and perform a function on the entire set.
